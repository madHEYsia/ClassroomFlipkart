Install Sourcetree / Github / Git Bash for code management.
Download and Install Java v1.8 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Why 1.8 ? Because we will be using 1.8 feature like lambda expression, etc which are not supported by lower Java versions.
